What is Testing? 
---> It is the process of evaluating a system to verify that it meets specified requirements and to identify defects (bugs). It is not just about "finding bugs," but about validating quality.

Why is it needed?
---> Cost-Saving: Fixing a bug in production is 10x more expensive than fixing it during development.
Security: Ensures sensitive user data (like passwords) is protected.
Customer Satisfaction: Provides a seamless, logic-driven user experience.
Reliability: Confirms the software won't crash under pressure.

Requirement Analysis
---> This is the first and most critical phase of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
The Goal: To understand exactly what the client wants before a single line of code is written.
The Documents: You analyze the BRD (Business Requirement Document) and SRS (Software Requirement Specification).
QE Role: We look for gaps. (e.g., "The requirement says users can log in, but it doesn't say what happens if they forget their password.")
