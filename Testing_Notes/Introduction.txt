What is Testing? 
---> It is the process of evaluating a system to verify that it meets specified requirements and to identify defects (bugs). It is not just about "finding bugs," but about validating quality.

Why is it needed?
---> Cost-Saving: Fixing a bug in production is 10x more expensive than fixing it during development.
Security: Ensures sensitive user data (like passwords) is protected.
Customer Satisfaction: Provides a seamless, logic-driven user experience.
Reliability: Confirms the software won't crash under pressure.
