What is Testing? 
---> It is the process of evaluating a system to verify that it meets specified requirements and to identify defects (bugs). It is not just about "finding bugs," but about validating quality.

Why is it needed?
---> Cost-Saving: Fixing a bug in production is 10x more expensive than fixing it during development.
Security: Ensures sensitive user data (like passwords) is protected.
Customer Satisfaction: Provides a seamless, logic-driven user experience.
Reliability: Confirms the software won't crash under pressure.

Requirement Analysis
---> This is the first and most critical phase of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
The Goal: To understand exactly what the client wants before a single line of code is written.
The Documents: You analyze the BRD (Business Requirement Document) and SRS (Software Requirement Specification).
QE Role: We look for gaps. (e.g., "The requirement says users can log in, but it doesn't say what happens if they forget their password.")

Low-Level vs. High-Level Testing
---> Low-Level Testing (LLT)
      Focus: The internal logic and components of the code.      
      Types: Unit Testing (testing a single function) and Integration Testing (testing how two modules talk to each other).      
      Who does it? Usually Developers or QE White-Box testers.

     High-Level Testing (HLT)
      Focus: The system as a whole from an end-user perspective.      
      Types: System Testing, Smoke Testing, and UAT (User Acceptance Testing).      
      Who does it? Manual and Automation QEs.

Functional vs. Non-Functional Testing
Functional	"What does the system do?"	Login, Search, Adding to Cart, Payments.
Non-Functional	"How does the system perform?"	Speed (Performance), Security, Usability, Load

Documentation
This includes your Test Plan (the strategy) and Test Cases (the step-by-step instructions). Good documentation ensures that if you leave the company tomorrow, another QE can run your tests perfectly.

Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
---> The RTM is a table that maps Requirements to Test Cases.
Why it's vital: It proves Test Coverage. If you have 10 requirements and 50 test cases, the RTM shows which test covers which requirement. If a requirement has no test case, you have a "hole" in your testing.
